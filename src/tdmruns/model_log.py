"""Parses the TDM's own `_Log\\_RunTime.txt` (written by the model scripts
themselves, via `_TimeStamp_ModelSuccess.block` / `_TimeStamp_ModelCrashed.block`
at :ENDMODEL / :ONERROR in the Hail Mary driver script) as a second, more
trustworthy signal for whether a model run actually succeeded.

Voyager's own process exit code, captured by RunModel.bat, is not reliable on
its own: real recorded runs of bring-work-trips-closer-to-home show the model
completing cleanly (a "TOTAL MODEL RUN TIME" entry, no crash marker) while
Voyager still returned a non-zero exit code, marking the run "failed" even
though every output was produced. The driver script also never calls Exit
after :ONERROR, so the reverse (a crash that still exits 0) is plausible too.
Reading the model's own self-report is strictly more accurate than trusting
the wrapping batch process's ERRORLEVEL.

The log file is opened with APPEND=T and reused across every CLI-driven retry
of a given scenario_id (the raw scenario folder is not unique per attempt),
so it can accumulate several full run reports over time. Only the most recent
one -- the text up to and including the last "TOTAL MODEL RUN TIME" entry --
describes this run.

Because the driver script never calls Exit from :ONERROR, a caught error logs
its crash+total block and execution simply falls through to whatever comes
next in the script, rather than stopping. If that next thing is another real
step, :ONERROR can fire again later for a different step, appending another
crash+total block, and so on, all within one single process run. So "TOTAL
MODEL RUN TIME" alone is not reliably a once-per-run final marker -- a crash+
total block can describe a superseded checkpoint that the run recovered from
and kept going past. read_model_log() therefore returns None (unresolved,
caller falls back to the exit code) whenever anything is logged *after* the
last TOTAL MODEL RUN TIME block, rather than trusting a possibly-superseded
checkpoint as this attempt's final outcome.

Newer TDM pins add an unambiguous fix for this: _TimeStamp_ModelSuccess.block
(only ever reached via the single :ENDMODEL, never :ONERROR) writes a
trailing "MODEL RUN SUCCESSFUL" line that the crash block does not. Its mere
presence at the true tail of the file is conclusive proof of a real finish,
regardless of how many crash+retry checkpoints came before it, so it's
checked first and preferred whenever present. A TDM pin that predates this
line falls back to the "nothing after the last TOTAL block" heuristic above.
