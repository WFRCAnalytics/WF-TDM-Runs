"""Parses the TDM's own `_Log\\_RunTime.txt` (written by the model scripts
themselves, via `_TimeStamp_ModelSuccess.block` / `_TimeStamp_ModelCrashed.block`
at :ENDMODEL / :ONERROR in the Hail Mary driver script) as a second, more
trustworthy signal for whether a model run actually succeeded.

Voyager's own process exit code, captured by RunModel.bat, is not reliable on
its own: real recorded runs of bring-work-trips-closer-to-home show the model
completing cleanly (a "TOTAL MODEL RUN TIME" entry, no crash marker) while
Voyager still returned a non-zero exit code, marking the run "failed" even
though every output was produced. The driver script also never calls Exit
after :ONERROR, so the reverse (a crash that still exits 0) is plausible too.
Reading the model's own self-report is strictly more accurate than trusting
the wrapping batch process's ERRORLEVEL.

The log file is opened with APPEND=T and reused across every CLI-driven retry
of a given scenario_id (the raw scenario folder is not unique per attempt),
so it can accumulate several full run reports over time. Only the most recent
one -- the text from the previous "TOTAL MODEL RUN TIME" entry (or the start
of the file) up to and including the last one -- describes this run.
