"""TDM submodule version resolution.

v1 design: the submodule is checked out in place and scenarios run
sequentially (one TDM version at a time), matching how the TDM batch entry
point actually executes -- in place, inside its own checkout, using its own
Scenarios/ folder convention. A dirty working tree or an unresolvable ref is
always a hard failure, never a warning, since silent execution against an
ambiguous checkout is exactly what destroys reproducibility later.
