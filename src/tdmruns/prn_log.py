"""Extracts Cube Voyager's own fatal-error messages from the scenario
folder's PRN print files, to fold the actual "F(NNN): <description>" text
into a failed run's error message alongside model_log.py's crashed_step
(which only names the .s step, not what Voyager itself reported).

Voyager numbers PRN files sequentially per RUN PGM= step (TPPLnnnn.PRN, ...)
directly in the scenario folder -- the same folder as _ControlCenter.block
and the Hail Mary driver script, never nested in a subfolder like
Temp/4_ModeChoice/ (those are step-local working copies, not where the
driver script's own PRN trail lands). The Hail Mary driver deletes every
*.PRN there at :BEGINMODEL (`*(DEL *.PRN)`), so whichever one has the newest
mtime when a run fails is unambiguously the one Voyager was writing when it
crashed.

Voyager's own runtime messages follow a `<Letter>(<code>): <description>`
line format -- confirmed from a real crash:

    F(004): Problems opening ..\\..\\..\\2_ModelScripts\\2_Tripgen\\1_TripGen_vizTool.s (err=2)
    F(004): OS reports: The system cannot find the file specified.

and from a real non-fatal example (an ARRAY NEIGHBORS memory-allocation
message):

    M(792): ARRAY NEIGHBORS requires 80 bytes.

F(...) is fatal, M(...) is an informational memory-allocation message, and
plain "F(x)" also shows up unrelated to any of this -- as a function/field
reference inside PILOT expressions (e.g. `F(2)`). What distinguishes a real
Voyager message from that is the fixed `): ` immediately after the code, and
that it always starts the line (Voyager, not scripted PILOT code, writes
it) -- an expression's `F(2)` never appears at the start of a line followed
by a colon. Anchoring on `^F(\\d+):` at line-start, rather than a bare
`F(\\d+)` search anywhere in the line, is what keeps this from matching
equation/field-reference uses of the same letter+parens shape.
