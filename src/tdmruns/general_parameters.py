"""GeneralParameters.block override rendering.

tdm/1_Inputs/0_GlobalData/GeneralParameters.block (config/framework.yaml's
general_parameters_path) is a single file shared by every scenario's
working folder -- the driver script's own `READ FILE = '..\\..\\1_Inputs\\
0_GlobalData\\GeneralParameters.block'` line resolves to the same file under
tdm/ no matter which scenario is running. So unlike the Control Center (see
controlcenter.py), a run can't override it by writing a per-run *copy* of
the whole file with substituted lines -- there's nothing to copy from
without touching tdm/ itself, which this framework never does, and the copy
would be shared/clobbered across scenarios anyway.

Instead: validate override keys against the real file (same typo-catching as
Control Center overrides, via controlcenter.validate_overrides), then write
only the overridden key/value pairs to a small per-run file
(OVERRIDE_FILENAME, in the scenario folder). driver_script.py inserts one
extra READ FILE line right after the real GeneralParameters.block READ so
Cube Voyager's own last-assignment-wins semantics apply the override -- the
~1200-line source file itself is never copied or modified.
