"""Control Center rendering for Cube Voyager's native .block format.

The TDM's Scenarios/_default/ library holds known-good, fully-populated
Control Center templates (one per scenario group/year) that an analyst would
normally copy and hand-edit. This module automates exactly that step: load
the chosen default, layer run set and scenario overrides on top, force in the
orchestrator-computed identity/path fields, layer in machine-local values,
and write the result out as the live _ControlCenter.block the TDM driver
script expects -- preserving every comment, blank line, and non-assignment
statement (if/else/endif, DISTRIBUTE, cluster commands, ...) from the
original template verbatim, and substituting only the lines whose key was
actually overridden.

Input file selection (e.g. WFRC_SEFile) and sensitivity knobs (e.g.
HOT_Toll_Min) are not treated as separate concerns -- they are both just keys
in this same file, so there is exactly one override mechanism.
